## COURSE FORMAT
This is a  'LIVE COURSE' – the instructor will be delivering lectures and coaching attendees through the accompanying computer practical's via video link, a good internet connection is essential.

## TIME ZONE
TIME ZONE – Central European Standard Time – however all sessions will be recorded and made available allowing attendees from different time zones to follow.

Please email [alexandre.wadoux@yahoo.fr](mailto:alexandre.wadoux@yahoo.fr) for full details or to discuss how we can accommodate you.

## ABOUT THE COURSE

This 3-day short course is aimed at providing an introduction to the analysis infrared spectroscopy data using the R programming language. Infrared spectroscopy is a high-throughput, non-destructive, and cheap sensing method that has a large range of applications in agricultural, plant and environmental sciences. Theory underpinning the visible, near and mid-infrared reflectance will be discussed, as well as interpretation of the wavelengths corresponding to specific molecular vibrations and the pre-processing of the raw spectra (day 1). We will then cover chemometric methods for exploratory spectral analysis with principal component analysis. We will have the opportunity to detect outlier spectra as well as to select the samples for laboratory analysis using the spectral data (day 2).  Finally, we will introduce methods for building accurate multivariate models. Multivariate models will be explained and tested, including machine learning and conventional statistical algorithms. Sessions will be a blend of interactive demonstrations/practical and lectures, where learners will have the opportunity to ask questions throughout. Prior to the course, attendees will receive R script and datasets and a list of R packages to install.

By the end of the course, participants should be able to:

* Select the best pre-processing techniques for their own raw infrared spectral data.
* Apply data exploration techniques and avoid the common pitfalls in tackling a data analysis of infrared spectral data.
* Select the optimal sample size and the best sampling design to subset spectral data and send the samples for laboratory analysis.
* Understand and apply approaches for spectral data outlier detection.
* Apply statistical multivariate modelling methods to infrared spectroscopy data and validate the model predictions.

A laptop computer with a working version of R or RStudio is required. R and RStudio are both available as free and open-source software for PCs, Macs, and Linux computers. R may be downloaded by following the links here https://www.r-project.org/. RStudio may be downloaded by following the links [R studio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

 - All the R packages that we will use in this course will be possible to download and install during the workshop itself as and when they are needed, and a full list of required packages will be made available to all attendees prior to the course.

 - A working webcam is desirable for enhanced interactivity during the live sessions, we encourage attendees to keep their cameras on during live zoom sessions.

 - Although not strictly required, using a large monitor or preferably even a second monitor will improve the learning experience
