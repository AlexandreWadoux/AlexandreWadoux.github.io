# ONLINE COURSE – **Quantitative analysis of infrared spectroscopy data for soil and plant sciences**
This course will be delivered live

**Tuesday, February 25th, 2025**

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/mycourse.gif">

## COURSE FORMAT
This is a  'LIVE COURSE' – the instructor will be delivering lectures and coaching attendees through the accompanying computer practical's via video link, a good internet connection is essential.

## TIME ZONE
TIME ZONE – Central European Standard Time – however all sessions will be recorded and made available allowing attendees from different time zones to follow.

Please email [alexandre.wadoux@yahoo.fr](mailto:alexandre.wadoux@yahoo.fr) for full details or to discuss how we can accommodate you.

## ABOUT THE COURSE

This **3-day short course** is aimed at providing an introduction to the analysis infrared spectroscopy data using the R programming language. Infrared spectroscopy is a high-throughput, non-destructive, and cheap sensing method that has a large range of applications in agricultural, plant and environmental sciences. Theory underpinning the visible, near and mid-infrared reflectance will be discussed, as well as interpretation of the wavelengths corresponding to specific molecular vibrations and the pre-processing of the raw spectra (**day 1**). We will then cover chemometric methods for exploratory spectral analysis with principal component analysis. We will have the opportunity to detect outlier spectra as well as to select the samples for laboratory analysis using the spectral data (**day 2**). Finally, we will introduce methods for building accurate multivariate models. Multivariate models will be explained and tested, including machine learning and conventional statistical algorithms (**day 3**). Sessions will be a blend of interactive demonstrations/practical and lectures, where learners will have the opportunity to ask questions throughout. Prior to the course, attendees will receive R script and datasets and a list of R packages to install.

By the end of the course, participants should be able to:

* Select the best pre-processing techniques for their own raw infrared spectral data.
* Apply data exploration techniques and avoid the common pitfalls in tackling a data analysis of infrared spectral data.
* Select the optimal sample size and the best sampling design to subset spectral data and send the samples for laboratory analysis.
* Understand and apply approaches for spectral data outlier detection.
* Apply statistical multivariate modelling methods to infrared spectroscopy data and validate the model predictions.

<details>
<summary><b>ASSUMED QUANTITATIVE KNOWLEDGE</b></summary>
Understanding of basic concept of sensing in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum and prior knowledge of basic statistical techniques (e.g. linear regression).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>ASSUMED COMPUTER BACKGROUND</b></summary>
Prior basic experience with performing statistical analyses using R and R Studio will be assumed, but is not a requirement.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT</b></summary>
A laptop with a working version of R or RStudio is required for this course. Both R and RStudio are free and open-source software available for PCs, Macs, and Linux computers. You can download R from the R Project website and RStudio from the RStudio website. During the workshop, all necessary R packages will be available for download and installation as needed, and a complete list of required packages will be shared with attendees in advance. While not mandatory, having a working webcam is encouraged to enhance interactivity during live sessions, and we recommend keeping cameras on during Zoom meetings. Additionally, using a large monitor or a second monitor can significantly improve the learning experience.
